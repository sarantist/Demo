## Description

This project is an example of a server-driven UI in Android. The application receives a JSON payload from a Firebase Realtime Database, which contains all the necessary elements for the UI. It then dynamically renders these elements on the screen, providing a flexible and responsive user experience.

The project leverages the power of Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. It follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, promoting a clear separation of concerns and easier testing.

With this server-driven approach, you can easily control your app's UI from the backend, allowing for quick updates and A/B testing without needing to release a new version of the app. This makes it a powerful tool for rapid, iterative development and user experience optimization.
